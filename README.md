# Email Management System

## Contribution Instructions
- Make sure your part uses the relevant data structure
- Use the predefined Email and User classes
- **Do NOT add pointer fields to the Email class** (its for our sanity, trust me)
- Feel free to use the DynArray class if you want, but dont trust it to be as optimized as std::vector
- Keep Code Clean and Readable
- Make sure the project runs before you contribute your code. If possible, test with the latest changes on Github.
