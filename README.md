## Responsibilities (According to the Assignment Specification)
- Main Menu - **[Kee Gene]**

## Index Generation for User and Email
```cpp
IdxGen idxGen;
User user_one(idxGen.nextUser(), "John", "j1@example.com");
User user_two(idxGen.nextUser(), "Jane", "j2@example.com");

Email email_one(idxGen.nextEmail(), user_one.getEmailAddress(), user_two.getEmailAddress(), "First", "Body One.");
Email email_two(idxGen.nextEmail(), user_one.getEmailAddress(), user_two.getEmailAddress(), "Second", "Body Two.");
Email email_three(idxGen.nextEmail(), user_one.getEmailAddress(), user_two.getEmailAddress(), "Third", "Body Three.");
Email email_four(idxGen.nextEmail(), user_one.getEmailAddress(), user_two.getEmailAddress(), "Fourth", "Body Four.");
	
```

## Contribution Instructions
- Make sure your part uses the relevant data structure
- Use the predefined Email and User classes
- **Do NOT add pointer fields to the Email class** (its for our sanity, trust me)
- Feel free to use the DynArray class if you want, but dont trust it to be as optimized as std::vector
- Keep Code Clean and Readable
- Make sure the project runs before you contribute your code. If possible, test with the latest changes on Github.
- **You can refer below for the design pattern I have in mind. However if you have our own idea that can work with this application, feel free to go for it**

## Design Pattern
#### The project uses an Object Oriented approach so we can work on our own part without affecting others. Take a look at the User class:
```cpp
class User {
private:
    /// Storage
    Inbox _inbox;
    Outbox _outbox;

    /// Features
    SearchService _searchService;
    SpamDetectionService _spamDetectionService;
    PriorityService _priorityService;
};
```
#### Each member is responsible for developing their part by selecting which field to modify based on the responsibility you choose. This field can then be used inside the User class to do various operations.

### Example
Inbox Class
```cpp
// Inbox.hpp
class Inbox {
public:
    Inbox() = default;
    ~Inbox() = default;

    void push(const Email& email);
    void removeEmail();
    Email peek() const;
    Email pop();
    void displayAll() const;

private:
    Stack<Email> _emails;
};
```

Inbox uses the Stack Data Structure, used as a field variable
```cpp
// Stack.hpp
template <typename T>
class Stack {
public:
    Stack(size_t capacity = 2);
    ~Stack();
    Stack(const Stack& other) = default;
    Stack(Stack&& other) noexcept = default;
    Stack& operator=(const Stack& other) = default;
    Stack& operator=(Stack&& other) noexcept = default;

public:
    bool isEmpty() const;
    void push(const T& data);
    void push(T&& data);
    template<typename... Args>
    void emplace(Args&&... args);
    T pop();
    T peek() const;

private:
    DynArray<T> _arr;
    int _topIdx = -1;
};

```
The Inbox _inbox field is then used inside the User class
```cpp
// User.cpp
class User {
public:

    // Other methods...

    void receiveEmail(const Email& email) {
        _inbox.push(email);
    }

    void sendEmail(const Email& email, User& receiver) {
        receiver.receiveEmail(email);
    }

private:
    Inbox _inbox;
    // Other fields...
};
```
